#Exception Handling

# try: something that might cause an exception
# except: do this if there WAS an exception
# else: do this if there were no exceptions (try succeeded)
# (maybe think of else as "what else it should do")
# finally: do this no matter what happens

# try:
#     file = open("a_file.txt")
#     a_dictionary = {"key": "value"}
#     print(a_dictionary["key"])
# except FileNotFoundError:
#     file = open("a_file.txt", "w")
#     file.write("Something")
# except KeyError as error_message:
#     print(f"The key {error_message} does not exist.")
# else:
#     content = file.read()
#     print(content)
# finally:
#     raise TypeError("This is an error that I made up.")

#BMI Example

# height = float(input("Height: "))
# weight = int(input("Weight: "))

# if height > 3:
#     raise ValueError("Human Height should not be over 3 meters.")

# bmi = weight / height ** 2
# print(bmi)
